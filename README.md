# To Do List

## What will the application do?
The name of the application is to do list. It is inspired by *Microsoft To Do*, and there are some innovations to further
improve user's experience. The To Do List has **four default list**, which are
 - My Day
 - Important
 - Planned 
 - Tasks

And user can also add their customized list to contain their *to do events*. User can add and delete the customized list,
but cannot delete or add default list. There are some functions that appear both in customized list and default list, which are:
- sort
- change background colour
- print list
- hide complete tasks

Each lists contain two sections, one being the unfinished events and other being completed events, user can choose to 
hide the complete tasks.


## Who will use it?
To Do List is quite useful to keep track of the upcoming event and list the things that need to be done. 
From my own perspective, I find to do list is quite useful to maintain a high productivity. 
And the to do list is for **everyone**, it can be used in different scenarios and by different groups of people. 
But I believe **students** can make the most use of it, to record thier assignment due date and things to study.


## Why is this project of interest to me?
I am reasonably passionate about these projects because of the practicability of the to do list. Another reason is 
that the market for the to do list application is enormous, as it is an application for everyone. 
I think it is an excellent opportunity to code a to do list application by myself. Finally, 
I can demonstrate the concept of polymorphism of Java in this application smoothly, and therefore can further improve
 smy programming skill.
