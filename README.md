# To Do List

## What will the application do?
The name of the application is to-do list. It is inspired by *Microsoft to-do*, and there are some innovations to further
improve user's experience. The to-do List has **four default list**, which are
 - My Day
 - Important
 - Planned 
 - Tasks

And user can also add their customized list to contain their *to-do tasks*. User can add and delete the customized list,
but cannot delete or add default list. There are some functions that appear both in customized list and default list, which are:
- sort
- change background colour
- print list
- hide complete tasks

Each lists contain two sections, one being the unfinished tasks and other being completed tasks, user can choose to 
hide the complete tasks.


## Who will use it?
to-do List is quite useful to keep track of the upcoming task and list the things that need to be done. 
From my own perspective, I find to-do list is quite useful to maintain a high productivity. 
And the to-do list is for **everyone**, it can be used in different scenarios and by different groups of people. 
But I believe **students** can make the most use of it, to record their assignment due date and things to study.


## Why is this project of interest to me?
I am reasonably passionate about these projects because of the practicability of the to-do list. Another reason is 
that the market for the to-do list application is enormous, as it is an application for everyone. 
I think it is an excellent opportunity to code a to-do list application by myself. Finally, 
I can demonstrate the concept of polymorphism of Java in this application smoothly, and therefore can further improve
 smy programming skill.
